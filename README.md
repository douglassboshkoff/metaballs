# Metaballs

##DISCLAIMER
I did not write the majority of this code. It was provided as boilerplate code in my graphics class taught at Swarthmore. The main files that
my partner and I modified were circle.h, circle.cpp, mypanelopengl.h, mypanelopengl.cpp, and the fragment and vertex shaders in the shaders directory. I do 
not claim to know how cmake works nor do I claim to know exactly how all of the Qt and openGL code functions.
